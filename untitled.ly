(ICE-OUT  /  PEACE-NOW)

Say ICE OUT—(ICE OUT)—say PEACE NOW—(PEACE NOW),

Say ICE OUT—(ICE OUT)—say PEACE NOW—(PEACE NOW),

Say ICE OUT—(ICE OUT)—say PEACE NOW—(PEACE NOW),

Power in the podium, pressure in the crowd,
When the people start marchin’, even quiet gets loud.

Cold streets, hot mic, hear the heart thump,
Paper trails, court files, a politics clump.

They wrote up there headlines, the events up till now,
So we came with the truth now they look like a clown.
Say ICE OUT—(ICE OUT)—say PEACE NOW—(PEACE NOW),

Pray for the city, yeah, pray for the youth—
We don’t need more smoke, we need way more truth.

And the city said “blackout”—no shops and no clocks,
When your dollars speak louder than sidewalk shop talks.

Turn pain into power, turn doubt into “how,”
The whole crowd yelling’ back:
ICE OUT… PEACE NOW.

This isn’t a movie, it’s not a parade,
This is real-life a pain that don’t fade.

Stories spin fast, The tapes talk right back,
Layers like winter coats stackes upon stackes.

We find peace with blizzards of reals and takes,
While officials trade statements as timelines get shaked.

They abused and Sprayed and pushed us around,
We stood strong with neighbors while standing our ground.
Say ICE OUT—(ICE OUT)—say PEACE NOW—(PEACE NOW),

They brought surges of hell with the nerve to lie,
But the streets got receipts to testify.

From Lake Street to skyline, the city shouts out:
The truth is right there with out a any doubt.

Clock hands spinning while the city stay proud:
Cold hands, warm hearts
ICE OUT, PEACE NOW.

They say “order,” but there story has holes,
The cameras don’t lie, the footage has souls.

Hear Mayor Fry with rage in his throat,
“Get the fuck out”— the quote with a note.

They shoved and pushed to shake up the crowd,
We locked arms for neighbors and we said it out loud.
Say ICE OUT—(ICE OUT)—say PEACE NOW—(PEACE NOW),

The city don’t want your “tough guy” jargon,
We've seen it before—they’ll be no pardon.

Trump talk, chest thump, stage smoke, rage tweet,
Policy on a dolly, rollin’ cold down on Lake Street.


The truth in the city, for you theres no pity
We don’t flinch and won’t bow
ICE OUT… PEACE NOW.

Gnome” with her chrome-plated spin
Cameras don’t lie for us its a win 

Bovino bravado and massacre chatter,
The truth hits harder cause the paper trails matter.

They rolled in like bullies to bully the town,
We stood ten toes deep and we held our ground.
Say ICE OUT—(ICE OUT)—say PEACE NOW—(PEACE NOW),

Vance in the frame with the “mission” refrain,
The city is fierce in the snow and the strain.

Homan the omen, with numbers and names,
A badge don’t absolve when the blood hits the same.

No revenge in the verse—just a clear-eyed vow:
Get the fuck out
ICE OUT… PEACE NOW.

No “press-line blessing” for a family in pieces,
No “spin-doctor sermon” while the truth need releases.

His healing hands and steady breath,
This country wants truth in the face of his death.

They shoved and they sprayed to silence the crowd,
We pulled out the drums and made then pound loud.
Say ICE OUT—(ICE OUT)—say PEACE NOW—(PEACE NOW),

If you want our respect, bring receipts, not smoke,
Bring the whole record, not a half-cut quote.

No respect for the spin when it steps on the dead,
No respect for the suits when they talk over bread.

No peace in a PR, no grace in paid mouths—
So we chant it right here:
ICE OUT… PEACE NOW.

They tried to rule by pressure, tried to win by doubt,
We chose love plus backbone and we called them out.

Cold hands, warm hearts, we don’t back down.
We’ll stand and stand strong
ICE OUT… PEACE NOW.

Say ICE OUT—(ICE OUT)—say PEACE NOW—(PEACE NOW),

Say ICE OUT—(ICE OUT)—say PEACE NOW—(PEACE NOW),

Say ICE OUT—(ICE OUT)—say PEACE NOW—(PEACE NOW),
